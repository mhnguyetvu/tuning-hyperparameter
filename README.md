# Tuning hyperparameter
The main difference between Bayesian search and the other methods is that the tuning algorithm optimizes its parameter selection in each round according to the previous round score. Thus, instead of randomly choosing the next set of parameters, the algorithm optimizes the choice, and likely reaches the best parameter set faster than the previous two methods. Meaning, this method chooses only the relevant search space and discards the ranges that will most likely not deliver the best solution. Thus, it can be beneficial when you have a large amount of data, the learning is slow, and you want to minimize the tuning time.
